# ScaleformBanking  
  
Basic Scaleform Banking for Standalone Cities.  
Uses Native GTAV Banking Scaleform.  
  
This is a rework of : [rF_ATM By neirbonhoj](https://github.com/neirbonhoj/rF_ATM)   
Their work was amazing, but needed alterations desperately to work with MY code EASILY.  

Standalone / Framework Independant.  
Uses Keyboard, Mouse & Controller navigation, all at once, where previously it didnt use anything but mouse.  
removed several transitory items from sitting in objects when they didnt need to.  
rmeoved need for script to know banking details, functions for inserting both exist at the top of both client and server files.
