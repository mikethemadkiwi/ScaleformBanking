# ScaleformBanking  
  
Basic Scaleform Banking for Standalone Cities.  
Uses Native GTAV Banking Scaleform.  
  
This is a rework of : [rF_ATM By neirbonhoj](https://github.com/neirbonhoj/rF_ATM)   
Conatins functions on both client and server to allow for simple framework integration.  
Their work was amazing, but needed DESPERATE updates to work with my code.  
Uses Keyboard, Mouse & Controller navigation, all at once, where previously it didnt use anything but mouse.  
removed several transitory items from sitting in an object for no reason.  
  
FORK AT WILL. CODE SHOULD BE FREE TO ALL.  
Enjoy. Madkiwi
